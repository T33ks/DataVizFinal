# Accessibility Improvements for Nuclear Dashboard

## Font Improvements

We've enhanced font readability while preserving the retro/cyberpunk aesthetic by adding:

1. **VT323** - A highly readable pixel font for data values (via `.font-data` class)
2. **Space Mono** - A clean monospace font for better content readability (via `.font-mono` class)
3. **Press Start 2P** - Retained for headlines and key UI elements, but used more sparingly

## Accessibility Enhancements

### Semantic HTML
- Added proper semantic roles to components
- Used `section` elements with proper ARIA attributes
- Added `aria-labelledby` to connect headings with their containers
- Added appropriate `role="alert"` for error and loading states

### Screen Reader Support
- Added `aria-live` regions for dynamic content
- Added hidden descriptive text for complex visuals via `.sr-only` class
- Made decorative elements invisible to screen readers with `aria-hidden="true"`
- Provided alternative descriptions for charts and visualizations

### Focus Management
- Added visible focus styles for keyboard navigation
- Enhanced contrast for interactive elements
- Used proper heading hierarchy

### Chart Accessibility
- Added `role="img"` with descriptive `aria-label` for D3 charts
- Included hidden descriptive text explaining chart purpose and data
- Improved tooltip design with better contrast and readability
- Used more readable fonts for axis labels and data points

### Color and Contrast
- Maintained the green/dark theme but improved contrast ratios
- Added text outlines to improve readability of glowing text
- Consistent color coding for status indicators

## CSS Enhancements

1. New utility classes:
   - `.data-value` - Uses VT323 for better readability of data points
   - `.data-label` - Uses Space Mono for better readability of labels

2. Improved focus states:
   - Added clear focus indicators for keyboard navigation
   - Ensured adequate contrast for focus states

3. Animation adjustments:
   - Reduced animation intensity for users with vestibular disorders
   - Ensured animations don't interfere with readability

## Best Practices Implemented

1. **Keyboard Navigation**: All interactive elements are keyboard accessible
2. **Screen Reader Support**: Proper ARIA attributes and hidden descriptive text
3. **Reduced Motion**: Animation intensity adjusted for better experience
4. **Color Independence**: Information is not conveyed by color alone
5. **Text Alternatives**: All non-text content has text alternatives
6. **Focus Visibility**: Clearly visible focus indicators

These improvements enhance the accessibility of the nuclear dashboard while maintaining its distinctive retro/cyberpunk aesthetic.
